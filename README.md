Cornucopia is a small CLI utility resting on `tokio-postgres` and designed to facilitate PostgreSQL workflows in Rust.

Cornucopia aims to get out of your way, transpiling your queries to Rust on demand without requiring you to maintain a live database connection. Each query is prepared against your schema, ensuring that the statement is valid SQL. These prepared statements are then be used to generate properly typed rust code for this query. Keep reading for more info, or take a look at the examples folder for a quickstart ðŸš€

## Install
### Docker
The CLI spawns a `postgres` container when it has  to generate Rust modules. Thus, you need to have a working `docker`. Note that **on Linux non-sudo users need to be in the docker group**. Read the official [installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [post-installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) steps.

### Dependencies
Cornucopia will generate queries powered by the `tokio` runtime through `tokio-postgres` and `deadpool-postgres`, so you will need add the latest version of these to your dependencies. You might need more dependencies depending on which features you inted to use, The code block below shows an example of what your dependencies might look like with every feature that `cornucopia` supports:
```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.17.0", features = ["full"] }
deadpool-postgres = { version = "0.10.2", features = ["serde"] }
postgres-types = { version = "0.2.2", features = ["derive"] }
tokio-postgres = { version = "0.7.5", features = [
    "with-serde_json-1",
    "with-time-0_3",
    "with-uuid-0_8",
    "with-eui48-1",
] }
serde = { version = "1.0.136", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0.79"
time = "0.3.9"
uuid = "0.8.2"
eui48 = "1.1.0"
```
You can omit `tokio-postgres` feature flags for `json`, `time`, `uuid`, `eui48` and their corresponding crates if you don't need them.

### Cornucopia CLI
Aside from the dependencies, you will need the lightweight `cornucopia` cli to generate your Rust modules. This can be done via a simple `cargo install cornucopia` which will pull the latest binary and install it in your `cargo` path.

## Concepts
This section explain a bit more about how cornucopia works. If you just want to get started, take a look at the examples folder.

Cornucopia is pretty simple to use. Your migrations and queries should each reside in a dedicated folder, and from there the CLI takes care of the rest for you. In the next sections, we'll explore the basic usage, but feel free to explore the CLI's whole interface using the `--help` option at any point.

### Migrations
New migrations can be added using the command `cornucopia migration new`. Cornucopia will automatically manage migrations when it generates your Rust modules, but you can also use the command `cornucopia migration run` to run migrations on your production database too if you so desire.

### Queries
Each `.sql` file in your query directory will be converted into a Rust module containing functions corresponding to these queries. These functions are fully typed so you know exactly what parameters it takes, and what it returns. Queries are augmented by [special comments](#meta-query-syntax) allowing you you quickly fine-tune them.

### Generated modules
Assuming you have the following migration
```sql
CREATE TABLE Authors (
    Id SERIAL NOT NULL,
    Name VARCHAR(70) NOT NULL,
    Country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(Id)
);
```
then, the following query
```sql
--! authors()*
SELECT * FROM Authors;
```
will be turned by `cornucopia` into
```rust
pub async fn authors(client: &Client) -> Result<Vec<(i32, String, String)>, Error> {
    let stmt = client
        .prepare_typed_cached(
            "SELECT * FROM Authors;", &[],
        )
        .await?;

    let res = client.query(&stmt, &[]).await?;

    let return_value = res
        .iter()
        .map(|res| {
            let return_value_0: i32 = res.get(0);
            let return_value_1: String = res.get(1);
            let return_value_2: String = res.get(2);
            (return_value_0, return_value_1, return_value_2)
        })
        .collect::<Vec<(i32, String, String)>>();
    Ok(return_value)
}
```
Not bad! The generated function uses prepared statements, a statement cache, and strong typing (Notice how the returned rows' types have been inferred!). This is only a taste of what you can achieve, but should be fairly representative of what's going on under the hood.

### Meta query syntax
As you may have noticed from the previous section, this little comment `--! authors()*` is doing a lot of heavy-lifting for us. It tells `cornucopia` to generate a function named `authors` which takes no parameters. Since there is no specified return, cornucopia lets PostgreSQL infer the types itself, which it is usually pretty good at. Then, there's the asterisk `*` which signals that this query will return zero or more results. That's how we ended up with a `Vec` return in the generated query in the [section above](#generated-modules).

Note that comments that do not start with `--!` are simply ignored by `cornucopia`, so feel free to use them as you usually would.

So, what else can we do with those annotations? The grammar can be summed up as:

```<NAME> (<PARAMS>) <RETURN> <QUANTIFIER>```

In the next sections we'll explore a bit more what these options mean and what you can do with them. The regexp-esque notation used in this section to describe the grammar is for illustrative purposes only, The full grammar is available in the `grammar.pest` file. Its very straightforward, so taking a look at the examples should also give you a good idea.

#### Name
```<NAME> = <IDENT>```
The name of the generated function. Has to be a valid Rust identifier.

#### Params
`<PARAMS> = <IDENT>,*`.
The parameters of the prepared statement, separated by commas, with an optional trailing comma. 

The order in which parameters are given corresponds to the parameter number (e.g. the first parameter is `$1` in the statement). **Every PostgreSQL parameter `$i` must have a corresponding parameter in the meta parameter list** .

#### Return type
There are two kinds of returns, implicit and explicit. 

##### Implicit return
```<RETURN> = <EMPTY>```.
Implicit returns don't name the returned columns. The column types are inferred using prepared statements. To make a return implicit, simply omit it (you don't have to write anything).

Implicit returns are further categorized into void, scalar, and tuple types dependenging on the number of columns returned. For example,

* A query returning no column would result in `()`
* A query returning a single `TEXT` column would result in `String`, 
* A query returning a `TEXT` and a `INTEGER` would result in `(String, i32)`

##### Explicit return
```<RETURN> = {<IDENT><NULLABLE_MARKER>?,*}```
Explicit returns give a name to the returned columns. The column types are inferred using prepared statements. To make a return explicit, list the returned column names inside curly brackets, in the same order as they are returned in the statement, separated by commas, with an optional trailing comma. Each identifier can also be followed by a nullable marker `?` that indicates the this return column is potentially null (`Option`al in Rust). **There must be exactly as many names in the explicit return the as there are returned columns**. Each query that has an explicit return will generate a Rust `struct` to hold the query data. For example, this query
```sql
--! example_query() {name, country} *
SELECT Name, Country FROM Authors;
```
would result in this struct being generated
```rust
pub struct ExampleQuery {
    pub name: String,
    pub country: String
}

pub async fn authors(client: &Client) -> Result<Vec<ExampleQuery>, Error> {
    /* ....omitted for brevity... */
}
```

#### Quantifier
```<QUANTIFIER> = <EMPTY> | * | ?```
The quantifier indicates the expected number of rows to be returned by a query. If no quantifier is specified, the it is assumed that only one record is to be returned. Using `*` and `?` (corresponding to the "zero or more" and "zero or one" quantifiers) will wrap the resulting rust type in a `Vec` and `Option` respectively. To sum it up:

* no quantifier results in `T`
* `*` results in `Vec<T>`
* `?` results in `Option<T>`

Note that explicit returns marks a columns as nullable with `?`, while the `?` quantifier acts on the whole row.

### Transactions
Cornucopia actually generates two versions of your queries, one that accepts a regular client (located inside the `queries`), while the other version accepts a transaction (located inside the `transactions`).
