Cornucopia is a small CLI utility resting on `tokio-postgres` designed to facilitate PostgreSQL workflows in Rust.

Cornucopia aims to get out of your way, **transpiling your PostgreSQL queries to Rust on demand**. Each query is prepared against your schema, ensuring that the query statements are valid SQL. These prepared statements are then be used to generate properly type-checked Rust code for this query.

##### Features
* SQL-first. Your database schema is the source of truth. No ORM.
* Custom user types (composites, enums and domains).
* Strongly-typed async row streams.
* One-dimensional array types.
* Nullable return columns.
* Optional migration management.
* Build your queries against your own live database, or let Cornucopia manage that for you.
* Use the connection type that you want (pooled or not, transaction or not). You can mix and match them freely.
* Compatible with `build.rs` to rebuild Rust queries whenever SQL files change.
* No macros, respects your compile times.

Keep reading for more info, or take a look at the [basic example](https://github.com/LouisGariepy/cornucopia/tree/main/examples/basic) for a quickstart ðŸš€.

## Install
### Container manager
Cornucopia spawns a `postgres` container when it generates your Rust modules, so, you'll need a working `docker` or `podman` command. **Note: If you only work in `live` mode, you may not need a container manager since you'll manage the database yourself**.

To use `docker` on Linux, **non-sudo users need to be in the docker group**. For a step-by-step guide, please read the official docker [installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [post-installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) docs. 

No special installation steps are needed for `podman`, but note that you will need to pass a CLI flag (`-p` or `--podman`) because `cornucopia` defaults to `docker`.

### Dependencies
#### Required
Cornucopia will generate queries powered by the `tokio` runtime through `tokio-postgres`, and it also uses some extended async features from `futures` so you will need add the latest version of these to your `Cargo.toml`. Finally, you will need the `cornucopia_client` crate, which has only one item: the `GenericClient` trait.

#### Optional
* Pooled connections: `deadpool-postgres`. 
* Custom PostgreSQL user types: `postgres_types`.

#### Extra types using `tokio_postgres` features
| Crate        | available types                                    | `tokio_postgres` feature |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `serde_json` | `Value`                                            | `with-serde_json-1`      |
| `time`       | `Date` `Time` `PrimitiveDateTime` `OffsetDateTime` | `with-time-0_3`          |
| `uuid`       | `Uuid`                                             | `with-uuid-1`            |
| `eui48`      | `MacAddress`                                       | `with-eui48-1`           |

#### Full dependencies
The code block below shows what your dependencies might look like with every feature that `cornucopia` supports enabled:
```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.18.1", features = ["full"] }
deadpool-postgres = { version = "0.10.2" }
postgres-types = { version = "0.2.3", features = ["derive"] }
cornucopia_client = "0.2.0"
futures = "0.3.21"
tokio-postgres = { version = "0.7.6", features = [
    "with-serde_json-1",
    "with-time-0_3",
    "with-uuid-1",
    "with-eui48-1",
] }
serde = { version = "1.0.137", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0.81"
time = "0.3.9"
uuid = "1.0.0"
eui48 = "1.1.0"
```
You can omit `tokio-postgres` feature flags for `json`, `time`, `uuid`, `eui48` and their corresponding crates if you don't need them.

### Cornucopia CLI
Aside from the dependencies, you will need the `cornucopia` cli to generate your Rust modules. This can be done via a simple `cargo install cornucopia` which will pull the latest binary and install it in your `cargo` path.

## Concepts
This section explain a bit more about how Cornucopia works. If you just want to get started, you should take a look at the [basic example](https://github.com/LouisGariepy/cornucopia/tree/main/examples/basic).

Cornucopia is pretty simple to use. In the next sections, we'll explore the basic usage, but feel free to look the CLI's whole interface using the `--help` option at any point. For convenience, the CLI's [reference document](https://github.com/LouisGariepy/cornucopia/blob/main/cli.md) is also available in this repository.

### Migrations
The basic `cornucopia generate` command spins a new container, runs your migrations, generates your queries and cleanups the container. If you want to manage the database and migrations yourself, use the `cornucopia generate live` command to connect to an arbitrary live database. Keep in mind that your queries must still be otherwise compatible with Cornucopia (e.g. with regards to [supported types](https://github.com/LouisGariepy/cornucopia#supported-types) and [annotation syntax](https://github.com/LouisGariepy/cornucopia#query-annotation-syntax)).

New migrations can be added using the command `cornucopia migration new`. 

Finally, as a convenience, you can use `cornucopia migration run` to run migrations on your database too if you so desire. This feature works in a pretty simple way, but is not yet thoroughly tested and it's advisable that you use another existing migration system.

### Queries
Each `.sql` file in your queries directory will be converted into a Rust module containing functions corresponding to each query. Each query is actually prepared against your schema, ensuring as many errors as possible will be caught before production. The generated functions are fully typed, giving you insight into your SQL and pretty strong guards against runtime errors.

### Generated modules
Assume you have the following migration:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Author (
    Id SERIAL NOT NULL,
    Name VARCHAR(70) NOT NULL,
    Country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(Id)
);
```
Then, the following query
```sql
--! authors()*
SELECT * FROM Author;
```
will be turned by `cornucopia` into
```rust
pub async fn authors<T: GenericClient>(client: &T) -> Result<Vec<(i32, String, String)>, Error> {
    let stmt = client.prepare("SELECT * FROM Author;").await?;
    let res = client.query(&stmt, &[]).await?;
    let return_value = res
        .iter()
        .map(|res| {
            let return_value_0: i32 = res.get(0);
            let return_value_1: String = res.get(1);
            let return_value_2: String = res.get(2);
            (return_value_0, return_value_1, return_value_2)
        })
        .collect::<Vec<(i32, String, String)>>();
    Ok(return_value)
}
```
Not bad! The generated function uses prepared statements, a statement cache, and strong typing (Notice how the returned rows' types have been inferred!). This is only a taste of what you can achieve, but should be fairly representative of what's going on under the hood.

### Query annotation syntax
As you may have noticed from the previous section, this little comment `--! authors()*` is doing a lot of heavy-lifting for us. It tells `cornucopia` to generate a function named `authors` with no parameters. Since there is no specified return, Cornucopia will automatically infer what's being returned. Then, the asterisk `*` signals that this query will return zero or more results (that's why we ended up with a `Vec` return in the generated query in the [section above](#generated-modules)).

Note: annotations are whitespace insignificant and can be split accross multiple lines too
```sql
--! authors (
--!
--! )
--! *
```
Comments that do not start with `--!` (e.g. `-- This`) are simply ignored by Cornucopia, so feel free to use them as you usually would.

So, what else can we do with those annotations? The grammar can be summed up as:
```<NAME> (<PARAMS>) <RETURN> <QUANTIFIER>```
The full grammar is available in the `grammar.pest` file, but you shouldn't have to dig through it at all; the syntax should look pretty intuitive.

The next subsections will explain what each token means. Each section start with examples so you should be able to follow just by skimming through.

#### Name
> `helloWorld2`, `informative_query_name`

The name of the generated function. It has to be a valid PostgresQL and Rust identifier.

#### Params
> `()`, `(a_nice_param, )`, `(a, b)`

The parameters of the prepared statement, separated by commas (with an optional trailing comma.) 

The order in which parameters are given corresponds to the parameter index (e.g. the first parameter is `$1` in the statement). **Every PostgreSQL parameter `$i` must have a corresponding parameter in the annotation parameter list**.

#### Return type
There are two kinds of returns, implicit and explicit. 

##### Implicit return
Implicit returns don't name the returned columns. The column types are inferred using prepared statements. To make a return implicit, simply omit it (you don't have to write anything).

Implicit returns are further categorized into void, scalar, and tuple types depending on the number of columns returned. For example,

* A query returning no column would result in `()`
* A query returning a single `TEXT` column would result in `String`, 
* A query returning a `TEXT` and a `INTEGER` would result in `(String, i32)`

##### Explicit return
> `{}`, `{cool_field, }`, `{a, b?, c}`

Explicit returns give a name to the returned columns. The column types are inferred using prepared statements. To make a return explicit, list the returned column names inside curly brackets, in the same order as they are returned in the statement, separated by commas, with an optional trailing comma. Each identifier can also be followed by an optional nullable marker `?` which indicates that the column is potentially null (`Option` in Rust). **There must be exactly as many names in the explicit return the as there are returned columns**. Each query that has an explicit return will generate a Rust `struct` to hold the query data. For example, this query
```sql
--! example_query() {name, country} *
SELECT Name, Country FROM Authors;
```
would result in this `struct` and function being generated
```rust
pub struct ExampleQuery {
    pub name: String,
    pub country: String
}

pub async fn authors<T: GenericClient>(client: &T) -> Result<Vec<ExampleQuery>, Error> {
    /* ....omitted for brevity... */
}
```

#### Quantifier
> ` ` (no quantifier), `?`, `*`, `#`

The quantifier indicates the expected number of rows returned by a query. No more than one quantifier can be used, and if no quantifier is specified, then it is assumed that only one record will be returned. Using `*` and `?` (corresponding to the "zero or more" and "zero or one" quantifiers) will wrap the resulting Rust type in a `Vec` and `Option` respectively. Additionally, there is the stream identifier `#` which is very similar to `*`, but produces a `Stream` instead of a `Vec` To sum it up:

* ` ` (no quantifier) results in `T`
* `*` results in `Vec<T>`
* `?` results in `Option<T>`
* `#` results in `impl Stream<Item = Result<T, Error>>`

Note that explicit return columns can be marked as nullable with `?`, while the `?` quantifier acts on the whole row.

### Transactions
Generated queries take a `GenericClient` as parameter, which accepts both `Client`s and `Transaction`s. That means you can use the same generated queries for both single statements and transactions.

### Connection pools
Generated queries take a `GenericClient` as parameter, which accepts both connections from `tokio-postgres` (non-pooled) and `deadpool_postgres` (pooled).

## Automatically generate queries
You can make use of Rust's build script feature to automatically regenerate your Cornucopia queries upon building your crate, only when your SQL has changed. The simplest way to achieve this is simply to call Cornucopia's CLI inside your `build.rs` file. You can learn more about this feature in this [example](examples/auto_build/README.md).

## Formatting
By default, Cornucopia will run `rustfmt` on your your queries to facilitate manual inspection of the code. If you don't want this, or you don't have access to `rustfmt` you can use the `--no-formatting` CLI flag.

## Supported types

| `timestamp with time zone`, `timestamptz`    | `time::OffsetDateTime`    |
| `date`                                       | `time::Date`              |
| `time`                                       | `time::Time`              |
| `json`                                       | `serde_json::Value`       |
| `jsonb`                                      | `serde_json::Value`       |
| `uuid`                                       | `uuid::Uuid`              |
| `inet`                                       | `std::net::IpAddr`        |
| `macaddr`                                    | `eui48::MacAddress`       |

### Custom types
Cornucopia also supports user-defined `enum`s, `composite`s and `domain`s. Just like base types, custom types will be generated automatically
by inspecting your database. The only requirement for your custom types is that they be based on other supported types (base or custom).
Cornucopia is also aware of your types' namespaces (what PostgreSQL calls schemas), so it will correctly handle custom types like `my_schema.my_custom_type`.

### Array types
Cornucopia supports one-dimensionnal arrays for which the element type is also a type supported . That is, Cornucopia supports `example_elem_type[]` if `example_elem_type` is itself a type supported by Cornucopia (base or custom).
